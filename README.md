#### AIS to KML

  This is the github page for my IB Computer Science SL IA. I am working with a client to produce a piece of software that reads AIS data transmitted through NMEA 0183 packets.

  Once data is decoded and the relevant information outputted to a file, the information will be stored in a KML file, so that it can be easily viewed via Google Earth.
